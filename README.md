# 🩸 Blood Bank Management System in C

## 📘 Overview
The **Blood Bank Management System** is a menu-driven mini project developed in **C language** to manage and organize donor records efficiently.  
It allows users to add, view, search, update, and delete donor information — all stored permanently in a text file (`bloodbank.txt`).

This project demonstrates how **file handling** and **structured programming** can be used to build a simple yet practical system for managing critical data.
